      Q: "TurnAround Time",
      A: "We are not dealing with projects according to time, and our pricing relies on a per-project basis.

      Q: "How to begin with us",
      A: "Our estimated time of delivery is between 24 – 48 hours. It depends on the size of a construction project. While the average rate of a construction project lies between 2-4 days. We also manage to deal with different projects that demand quick delivery. You just have to notify us of the bid date, and our professional estimators will assist you accordingly. It costs a minor expedite fee so that things go better. Also, you will receive a quick delivery within a guaranteed date.",
